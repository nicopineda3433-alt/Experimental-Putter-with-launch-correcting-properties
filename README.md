# Experimental-Putter-with-launch-correcting-properties
A putter that minimizes twisting on off-center hits (torque-free), promotes consistent forward roll and ball speed across the face with differing groove spacing and depth, corrects typical pushes and pulls via progressive angled groove design, optimizes CG depth and weighting, and includes variable face thickness for uniform energy transfer.

This is where the project files will be uploaded based on version updates.
